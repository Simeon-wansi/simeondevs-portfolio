## ✅ Projects Display Issue - RESOLVED

### Problem:
- Projects were not showing on the Projects page
- Statistics showed 0 for all counts (Total, Completed, In Progress)
- Projects were only initialized once on page load, not on navigation

### Root Cause:
The projects were only being initialized when the page first loaded, but not when users navigated to the Projects page using the SPA (Single Page Application) navigation system.

### Solution Applied:
1. **Enhanced Page Navigation**: Modified the `triggerPageAnimations` function in `main.js` to reinitialize projects when navigating to the Projects page
2. **Added Global Export**: Exported `initializeProjects` function globally so it can be called from the navigation system
3. **Navigation Integration**: Added project re-initialization to the 'projects' case in the page switching logic

### Technical Changes:
- **main.js**: Added project initialization call to `triggerPageAnimations` for 'projects' page
- **projects.js**: Added `initializeProjects` to global exports and `window.SimeonDevProjects` object

### Result:
- ✅ Projects now display correctly on the Projects page
- ✅ Statistics update properly (showing actual counts)
- ✅ All project filtering and interactions work correctly
- ✅ Featured projects on home page remain static as intended
- ✅ Navigation between pages works seamlessly

### Files Modified:
- `js/main.js`: Enhanced page navigation to reinitialize projects
- `js/projects.js`: Added function exports for navigation integration

The issue is now completely resolved and projects display correctly on both initial load and navigation.
